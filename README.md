# Advent of Code 2024
___
Hoho! It's christmas time and with that the official begin of the advent of code. Get ready to 
open calendar doors and get late to PT1 just because you need to wait until your brute force 
algorithm is finished running. 

At the end of the day nobody cares if you got your solution executes in under 
10 ms or 2 hours. After all, what is $O(n^2)$ between friends?
